    "In this section, we will focus on tasks to process inputs, i.e. the tasks that take the input and generate a useful output, often through a series of steps. It is sometimes important for the model to reason in detail about a problem before answering a specific question.\n",
    "\n",
    "Sometimes a model makes reasoning errors by rushing to an incorrect conclusion, so we can reframe the query to request a series of relevant reasoning steps before the model provides a final answer so that it can think longer and more methodically about the problem. And in general, we call this strategy of asking the model to reason about a problem in steps, \"Chain of thought reasoning\".\n",
    "\n",
    "For some applications, the reasoning process that a model uses to arrive at a final answer would be inappropriate to share with the user. \n",
    "\n",
    "For example, In tutoring applications, we may want to encourage students to work on their answers, but a model's reasoning process about the student's solution could reveal the answer to the student.\n",
    "\n",
    "Inner monologue is a tactic that can be used to mitigate this, and this is just a fancy way of hiding the model's reasoning from the user.\n",
    "The idea of inner monologue is to instruct the model to put parts of the output that are meant to be hidden from the user into a structured format that makes passing them easy. Then, before presenting the output to the user, the output is passed and only part of the output is made visible."
